[ENGINE_DATA]
ALTITUDE_SENSITIVITY=0.1			; sensitivity to altitude
INERTIA=0.170					; engine inertia
LIMITER=7700					; engine rev limiter. 0 no limiter

[COAST_REF]
RPM=7000						; rev number reference
TORQUE=116						; engine braking torque value in Nm at rev number reference
NON_LINEARITY=0					; coast engine brake from ZERO to TORQUE value at rpm with linear (0) to fully exponential (1)

[TURBO_0]
LAG_DN=0.991						; Interpolation lag used slowing down the turbo
LAG_UP=0.995					; Interpolation lag used to spin up the turbo
MAX_BOOST=0.1 					; Maximum boost generated. This value is never exceeded and multiply the torque like T=T*(1.0 + boost), so a boost of 2 will give you 3 times the torque at a given rpm.
WASTEGATE=0.1					; Max level of boost before the wastegate does its things. 0 = no wastegate
